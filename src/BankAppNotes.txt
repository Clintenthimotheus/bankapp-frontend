               11.Reactive forms
                 Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling forms
                 inputs whose values change over time.
                 Reactive forms are built around observable streams,where form inputs and values are provided as
                 streams of input values ,which can be accessed synchronously

                 12.To use reactive form controls, import ReactiveFormsModule from the @angular/forms package and add it to your NgModule's imports array.
                  import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

                 @NgModule({

                           imports: [
                          // other imports ...
                         ReactiveFormsModule
                    ],
                       })
                    export class AppModule { }
                   ->FormGroup - ts
                   ->FormArray -ts
                   ->FormControl -html

              ->FormBuilder

              The FormBuilder provides syntactic sugar that shortens creating instances of 
              a FormControl, FormGroup, or FormArray.
              It reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to build complex forms.



              ->FormGroup-ts

              Constructs a new FormGroup instance.
               Accepts a single generic argument,
               which is an object containing all the keys and corresponding inner control types.
